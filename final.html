    <h1>The Top 10 Most Underrated U.S. Vacation Destinations (per The Onion)</h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pittsburg, Pennsylvania</li>
            <ul>If you think of Pittsburgh as an old Rust Belt city, then you haven’t been here since it was completely power-washed in the late 2000s.</ul>
            <li>Indianapolis, Indiana</li>
            <ul>No city offers visitors a renewed appreciation for their own hometown like Indianapolis.</ul>
            <li>Cleveland, Ohio</li>
            <ul>This oft-overlooked gem on the shore of Lake Erie offers the unbeatable thrill of nearly 400,000 residents insisting in unison that their city is underrated.</ul>
            <li>Fort Worth, Texas</li>
            <ul>Fort Worth has been working really hard on their downtown and it would really mean a lot to them if you would go pay it a visit.</ul>
            <li>The Grand Canyon</li>
            <ul>Wait until you hear about this place.</ul>
            <li>Albany, New York</li>
            <ul>All the razzle dazzle of Syracuse combined with the natural beauty of Poughkeepsie.</ul>
            <li>Pierre, South Dakota</li>
            <ul>Or wait, is Pierre in North Dakota? Either way, it doesn’t really matter.</ul>
            <li>Madison, Wisconsin</li>
            <ul>With an abundance of independent bookstores, dive bars, and hip coffeeshops, this quiet central Wisconsin city could be easily mistaken for any other college town.</ul>
            <li>Clewiston, Florida</li>
            <ul>Stacy lives there now.</ul>
            <li>Davenport</li>
            <ul>There’s a rest stop up here unless you can hold it until we get to Muscatine.</ul>
        </ol>
